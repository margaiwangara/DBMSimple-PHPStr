  <h4 class='display-4'>Welcome To DBMSimple</h4>
  <p class='lead'>This project contains basic PHP and MySQL commands from a beginner's perspective. I have used structured PHP for backend and front-end is done in bootstrap. I have also used basic MySQL commands to perform CRUD operations and display data however I want. Tables contained are related on different levels which cascade based on a user's operations. This project is still under construction and will be completed soon.</p>
